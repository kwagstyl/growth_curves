This project aims to model normal neurodevelopment and compare either individual scans or 
cohorts of scans to a control dataset to identify focal abnormalities.

Notes:
Please check the formatting of segmented cohorts (BIDS formatting).
These scripts produce various files, please create a new folder as a destination.
